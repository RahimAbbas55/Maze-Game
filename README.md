# Maze-Game
Console-Based Maze Game built in C++ Data Structures
This game starts by asking the user to enter their name. Then, the default inventory is set up. Your goal is to navigate through maze and reach the treasure. The player is denoted by "L" and treasure by "T". There are many things availabl in the maze like obstacles, keys, and enemies denoted by "O" , "K" and "E" respectively. You also encounter locked doors which you can open using keys or answering a hangman puzzle if you don't have keys.
There is also a file name "A3" in the commits which have the entire description of the game. Feel free to use the code and don't forget to creedit me as it's owner ðŸ˜Š.
